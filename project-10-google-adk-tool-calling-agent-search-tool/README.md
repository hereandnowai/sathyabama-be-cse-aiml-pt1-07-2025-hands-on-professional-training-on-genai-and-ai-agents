**HERE AND NOW AI**

*designed with passion for innovation*

---

## Project Description

This project showcases how to use one of the powerful built-in tools in the Google ADK: the Google Search tool. The agent will be able to answer questions by searching the web. This is a fundamental example of how to ground an agent in real-world information.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk==0.1.0
    ```


2.  **Run the script:**

    # 1. Go to your projects directory
    cd ~/Documents/Projects

    # 2. Create the project
    adk create app MyChatAgent

    # (The ADK might ask you some questions here, like the agent type)

    # 3. Go into the project directory
    cd MyChatAgent

    # 5. Run the agent
    adk run app

3.  **Interact with the agent:**

    When prompted, ask a question that requires a web search, for example:

    ```
    What is the capital of France?
    ```

4.  **Expected Output:**

    The agent will use the Google Search tool to find the answer and present it to you.
